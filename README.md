# Austin's MyReads Project

This is my project for the first leg of the Udacity React nanodegree program. As of now the project makes use of the provided Udacity BooksApi to get my list of books and disperses them between three bookshelfs (Currently Reading, Want to Read, Read). There is also a search functionality to add more books to either of the three shelves.

## What you need to do

To test out this project all you need to do is:

`npm install`
    then
`npm start`
